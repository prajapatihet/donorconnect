# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # IMPORTANT NOTE: These parameters do not affect the configuration of Android 12 and later, which
  # handle splash screens differently than prior versions of Android. Android 12 and later must be
  # configured specifically in the android_12 section below.

  # color or background_image is the only required parameter. Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color. Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image. This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretched to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used; color and background_image cannot both be set.
  color: "#ffffff"
  #background_image: "assets/"

  # Optional parameters are listed below. To enable a parameter, uncomment the line by removing
  # the leading # character.

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen. It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  image: assets/images/logo.png

  # From Android 12 onwards, the splash screen is handled differently than in previous versions.
  # Following are specific parameters for Android 12+.
  android_12:
    # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image. If this parameter is not specified,
    # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
    image: assets/images/logo.png

    # Splash screen background color.
    color: "#ffffff"
